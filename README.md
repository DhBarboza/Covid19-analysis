## Covid19-analysis
Analysis of data on covid-19

### Data
- The data source used is found: [covid-19](https://github.com/whoismurilo/covid_19/blob/main/caso.csv.gz), 
- I also made it available in the folder `data` (File: ***caso.csv.gz***) and (File: ***Data_covid-19_SP***)
- Extraction and cleaning of the data was done removing the null values, and then separate to work with the information from the state of *s√£o paulo*

### Tools
- I used the google colab environment to perform data processing
